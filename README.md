And youâ€™re done!

## How It Works

When you watch a YouTube short, the URL takes the form: `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/[ID]`. It turns out this ID is the same one that they use for other videos. That means you can navigate to `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/watch?v=[ID]` and watch the same video with their regular video player.
